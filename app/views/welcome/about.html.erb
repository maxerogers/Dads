	    <p>"My passion and great enjoyment for architecture, and the reason the older I get the more I enjoy it, is because we - architects - can affect the quality of life of peopl" Richard Rogers</p>

		<p>I believe every space should be imbued with a sense of self, the essence of its inhabitant. Our works are like custom clothes, we want them to fit perfectly.
		We strive on every project, residential or commercial to create a special and unique sense of well-being. It is not only possible, but essential, to bring the heart of our clients into their spaces so they enfold, embrace and elevate their spirits.</p><p>
		We achieve this by listening. Often I find we are listening for the silent signals between their actual words: the moments, gestures, expressions, which show us their true heart's desires. People are often slow to reveal these inner hopes, so fragile and so often at first invisible even to themselves.</p>
